# 💡 Project: “React Task Manager 2.0”
## 📝 Description:
Rebuild the exact same Task Manager but using React this time.

**Core Concepts to Learn:**
- React Component Modal
- JSX What is it?
- State management
- Refer to React Docs instead of CHATGPT.

**Bonus Goals:**
- Use `useReducer` for more complex state management
- Add a modal to edit tasks
- Create reusable components (Task, TaskList, FilterButtons, etc.)
- Use Context API to manage theme (light/dark mode)
